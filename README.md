# CSGN_model_for_nmi
This is a repository for CSGN model.
Detailed description please checked in our manuscript.

## Description
This is a deep learning model for multi-atom cluster representation, complex spectrum generation, and material design, which is based on the cluster encoder and spectrum generator blocks.
